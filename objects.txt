
Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?

* An object is a standalone entity, with properties and type.

* Creating Objects in JavaScript:
    1) By object literal
    2) By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)

* By object literal

     syntax :
     
      object = {property1:value1,property2:value2} 

      Property and value is separated by colon(:).

 *  By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)     
      
      example:

      var myCar = new Object();
      myCar.make = 'Ford';
      myCar.model = 'Mustang';
      myCar.year = 1969;

 * To accsess javascript objects
 
     objectName.property or objectName[“property”]
